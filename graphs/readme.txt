BACKGROUND

There are *many* graph-drawing libraries. Today, I did my every-five-years hunt for an up-to-date library that would be good for students who are new to Javascript. This time, I landed on plotly. So the samples here are plotly samples. Pretty easy to learn, pretty good website, etc. But if you like some other system better, go wild.

This directory includes one web page containing three simple charts: a line chart, a bar chart, and a pie chart.


USING THIS SAMPLE

Just open the HTML file in a browser and poke around. Read the HTML, the CSS, and the JS.
